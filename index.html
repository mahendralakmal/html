It uses non-invasive methodologies, evidence based research, self-assessment, physical measurement data of champion sportspeople, physical movement attribute tests, to collect, corroborate, confirm and validate the conclusions arrived at, to generate a report which is scientifically sound.</p> </div> <div class="div2 div-hide"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button> <h1>About Report</h1> <p>This report helps identify the ideal sport and ideal position/event within that sport, which best suits your child, to help him/her succeed, according to his/her physical attributes. Identifying your child’s sporting talent well in advance gives the child sufficient time and opportunity to hone his/her skill to that of world-class levels during the primary and secondary schooling years.</p> <p>This report further provides a guide on how best to invest your finances, be it choosing the right coach or in the areas which require nurturing. Your child’s natural physical abilities are matched to the sports which mimic and demand the identical physical abilities of your child. The report also tells you whether your child has the talent to be able to represent the school, achieve a minimum club level performance, or be able to represent the country one day, should he/she diligently follow the recommendations made by this SportUnleash report and be wholeheartedly committed to the chosen sport during the years at school.</p> </div> <div class="div3 div-hide"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button> <h1>Report Benefits</h1> <ol> <li> <div><b>Accelerated Performance</b> </div> <div> <p>As your child competes in the SportUnleash suggested sport(s), your child will quickly start to excel, making great strides and becoming one of the best performers in that sport(s) in his/her age group.</p> </div> </li> <li> <div><b>Develops The Right Attitude</b> </div> <div> <p>Competing in a sport at which your child is naturally likely to succeed, will motivate him/her to train harder and be perceived as the best. Fewer parental lecturers will be required to get him/her motivated or even to stay committed to the task.</p> </div> </li> <li> <div><b>Avoids Disappointment</b> </div> <div> <p>Generally, talent is identified during a child’s mid-teens. Unfortunately by this time, many have lost interest in sports after numerous failures, and the few keen children have fewer years left in school to hone their skill, thus cutting short a possible great sporting career. The SportUnleash report gives you advance notice to avoid the usual disappointments.</p> </div> </li> <li> <div><b>Keeps Them Engaged In Sport</b> </div> <p>Children get used to the idea that they can be winners. They start to enjoy the wins they get from their hard work, which in turn makes them want to work even harder. On the flip side, they also start to realise the benefits of team work and develop the ability to take winning and losing in their own stride. This is very much a character building process that has a more positive effect on your child.</p> </li> <li> <div><b>Maximises Your Investment</b> </div> <p>The SportsUnleash report shows you where to best invest your valuable resources in order for your child to enjoy a sport, thrive and succeed.</p> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="div4 div-hide"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button> <h1>Sample Talent Profile</h1> <div class="sample-report"> <img src="/static/images/Sports-Talent-Profile-Sample-Report.png" alt="Sports-Talent-Profile-Sample-Report"> </div> </div> <div class="div5 div-hide"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button> <h1>Full Report Contents</h1> <ol> <li>What is the SportUnleash report & its benefits?</li> <li>How best to understand the various aspects of  the SportUnleash report? <ul> <li>Your child’s most capable sports and positions/events.</li> <li>Your child’s next best match sports and positions/events.</li> <li>Your child’s other potential sports and positions/events.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Keys to maximising a child’s genetic potential.</li> <li>Macronutrients that change the game.</li> <li>Protein: <ul> <li>How much</li> <li>Your child’s requirements</li> <li>Foods.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Carbohydrates: Your child’s requirement.</li> <li>Nutrition Intake: <ul> <li>Eating style</li> <li>Meals prior to training or competition</li> <li>During training or competition</li> <li>Post training or competition</li> <li>Biggest mistake in all nutrition.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Injury Prevention <ul> <li>Training:</li> <li>Remodeling the body according to a sport</li> <li>Muscle</li> <li>Flexibility and stretching</li> <li>Plyometrics</li> </ul> </li> <li>Caution: <ul> <li>Excess Fat</li> <li>Fat to weight percentage</li> <li>Strength training</li> <li>Overtraining</li> <li>Overheating</li> <li>Cramping</li> </ul> </li> <li>Supplements, Sports drinks, Energy drinks</li> <li>Fathers, how you can encourage your child</li> <li>Contact information: Coaches</li> </ol> </div> <div class="div6 div-hide"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button> <h1>Test Your Child</h1> <div> <dl> <dt>Step 1</dt> <dd>Contact a SportUnleash Specialist (SUS) official in your region, and fill in a form for testing.</dd> <dt>Step 2</dt> <dd>The SUS official will arrange a time to test your child.</dd> <dt>Step 3</dt> <dd>When the SUS official sends your child’s data to the SportUnleash head office, an sms will be sent to your phone confirming that we have received your child’s test data.</dd> <dt>Step 4</dt> <dd>When you receive the confirmation that we have received your child’s test data make the payment to the SUS official.</dd> <dt>Step 5</dt> <dd>Once the SUS official has received your payment he/she will then confirm that the payment has been received to the head office at which point you will also receive a receipt for the payment made to your phone via an sms.</dd> <dt>Step 6</dt> <dd>Within 7 days your child’s SportUnleash report will be sent to the SUS official and you will receive a confirmation via sms.</dd> <dt>Step 7</dt> <dd>The SUS official would then hand over the report to you.</dd> <dt>Step 8</dt> <dd>Once the report has been received, reply to the last text by typing “yes”.</dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="div7 div-hide"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button> <h1>Founder &amp; CEO</h1> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-7"> <p>Talavou Alailima, the inventor and the architect of the SportUnleash talent identification system, is a pioneer of the emerging world fitness industry with his chain of “Power World’ Fitness Centres (1994), “Edge” Sports Nutrition Supplements (2005), and “Lion Warrior” Sports High performance program (2008).

There is also the vital input from other systems such as the nervous system etc. The muscle fibres, depending on the genetic makeup of an individual may be fast twitch dominant (also known as the white fibre), slow twitch dominant (also known as the red fibre) or a similar mix of both.</p> <p>Each sporting activity utilises these muscle fibres in a combination of ways. For example a one hundred metre sprinter will use the fast twitch fibres to generate massive power in their lower body muscles. On the other extreme a marathon runner will use the slow twitch red fibres to generate a sustained, longer period of muscle contraction and relaxation to last the length of the race.</p> <p>If one were to identify what combination of these muscle fibres an individual has, then it is possible to predict what sort of sports activity that individual is suitable for. Further, focused training will enhance the growth of these fibres making the sportsperson perfectly adapted to the selected sporting activity.</p> <p>The idea of Sports Talent identification at an early age has been discussed extensively within the circles of the sports science and medical fraternity for many years now.

Smartphones, iPads, tablets and Facebook offer a plethora of entertainment making the need to get out and sweat uninviting. Today’s teenagers are more likely to pursue a sport only if they believe they have a good chance of succeeding and making it to their school team.</p> <p>This kind of thinking is reaching epidemic levels whereby teenagers have started to lose out on the benefits sports offer. Many have difficulty working in a group, taking constructive criticism and even handling victory or defeat in their stride. When playing a sport these aspects are carefully nurtured in a controlled environment which helps to build strong character. The physical and mental health benefits lost out are too numerous to count for those children who give up doing a sport early in their school life. This loss tends to also affect their health in the long term as well.</p> <p>It is not just about doing any sport, but choosing the appropriate sport for which each child is gifted with the appropriate physical attributes. New technology today allows us to match a child´s physical attributes with a particular set of sports. This knowledge will automatically help motivate and stimulate passion and commitment within children to continue in a sport throughout their school life and to become the best.</p> </div> <div class="tab2 tab-hide T2"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button> <h1>The Prize Money Bigger Than Ever</h1> <p>Over the last decade we have seen an exponential growth in the income generated by sports personalities and sports franchises the world over. As a result of this phenomenon, the desire and the possibility of becoming mega rich sportspeople have begun to drive parents and children alike to dream of such achievements and participate in a sport having such a target in mind; going to great lengths to see this become a reality.</p> <p>However, neither the parents, nor the coaches have a dependable way of predicting the sport a child is best/better suited for. It is a random game of chance where fate is left in the “hands of the gods”. Therefore, the only way forward is for them to then pursue, invest time, energy and commit resources towards such a dream for years, in the blind hope that maybe their child will one day be the next prodigy of the nation or of a wealthy super successful sports franchise.</p> </div> <div class="tab3 tab-hide T3"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button> <h1>Emerging/Developing Nations Changing The Game</h1> <p>Sports high performance is the ability for an individual or team to compete in the world arena, and realise noteworthy achievements that are second to none. When such highly motivated and well-trained individuals compete for honours, the margin between victory and defeat is small. Such performances demand precision training and a pioneering spirit that re-invents and challenges the accepted norms for excellence.</p> <p>Sadly however, whenever developing nations such as ours compete against champion teams from the developed world, the margin of defeat is enormous and, after decades of competing, we have become mere spectators at world events. As our economies have become wealthier however, we have invested in acquiring knowledge from coaches in the very countries that create world champions. Unfortunately, our teams’ and sportspeople’s real progress in comparison to the investments made annually is negligible.</p> </div> <div class="tab4 tab-hide T4"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;</button> <h1>Stunted By Lack Of Expertise</h1> <p>Expertise to be able to identify the talent of children at any age level is rare and when this does take place, it is only along the lines of selecting the best talent out of a pool of existing sportspeople in a particular sport or event. If any type of identification of talent is being carried out, it is taking place in a few developed countries behind closed doors and even in such instances by a handful of individuals working on an individual sportsperson at a time. No mechanism or expertise is widely available to the public to test the sports talent across schools or a nation within a short period of time, by analysing their physical capabilities and matching them with all the types of sports that exist.</p> <p>This inability to advise, guide and promote the talent of sportspeople at early ages not only stunts our sports development programs, but also hinders our country’s capabilities to uplift its competitiveness in the world arena.</p> </div> <div class="tab_info_ly"></div> </div> </div> <div class="video-content container con-lat-tab"></div> </div> </div> <div id="callout-column"> <ul class="callout-actions"> <li class="container" rel="endosement1"> <div class="col-md-11 container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 descript"> <p>“I find the SportUnleash system consistent with the accepted science and its ability to identify the talent of a 9 year old for a particular sport, before that child has had exposure to an organised sport or activity, makes the SportUnleash testing program stand out” <span class="callout-relative-bullet-base">&nbsp;Read More</span> </p> </div> <div class="col-md-4 descript"> <img src="static/images/Endorsement/SportUnleash-Dr-David-Young.jpg" alt="SportUnleash-Dr-David-Young"> </div> <div class="col-md-8 right-pane"> <p><b>Dr. David Young</b> </p> <p>Melbourne Orthopaedic Group, Australia Orthopaedic Surgeon, Special Area of Interest: Sports Injuries, Hip & Knee Surgery</p> <p>Orthopaedic Surgeon for the Australian and Sri Lankan cricket teams</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li class="container" rel="endosement2"> <div class="col-md-11 container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12 descript"> <p>“SportUnleash has taken that which was in its concept stage and made it a reality.
