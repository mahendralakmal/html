                                <p>SportUnleash is a sports talent and physical attribute identification algorithm of children. It uses non-invasive methodologies, evidence based research, self-assessment, physical measurement data of champion sportspeople, physical movement attribute tests, to collect, corroborate, confirm and validate the conclusions arrived at, to generate a report which is scientifically sound.</p>

                                <p>This report helps identify the ideal sport and ideal position/event within that sport, which best suits your child, to help him/her succeed, according to his/her physical attributes. Identifying your child’s sporting talent well in advance gives the child sufficient time and opportunity to hone his/her skill to that of world-class levels during the primary and secondary schooling years.</p>
                                <p>This report further provides a guide on how best to invest your finances, be it choosing the right coach or in the areas which require nurturing. Your child’s natural physical abilities are matched to the sports which mimic and demand the identical physical abilities of your child. The report also tells you  whether your child has the talent to be able to represent the school, achieve a minimum club level performance, or be able to represent the country one day, should he/she diligently follow the recommendations made by this SportUnleash report and be wholeheartedly committed to the chosen sport during the years at school.</p>

Unfortunately by this time, many have lost interest in sports after numerous failures, and the few keen children have fewer years left in school to hone their skill, thus cutting short a possible great sporting career.

                                        <p>Children get used to the idea that they can be winners. They start to enjoy the wins they get from their hard work, which in turn makes them want to work even harder. On the flip side, they also start to realize the benefits of team work and develop the ability to take winning and losing in their own stride. This is very much a character building process that has a more positive effect on your child.</p>

Its ability to identify the talent of a 9 year old for a particular sport, before that child has had exposure to an organised sport or activity makes the SportUnleash testing program stand out. …Those who get SportUnleash tested would even experience minimum injuries taking place in the long run as their natural physical makeup would match and will be able to withstand the physical demands of their chosen sport”</p>

SportUnleash has taken that which was in its concept stage and made it a reality. This innovation makes it now possible to unlock and push the true potential of the human body to achieve a new level of performance. …The non invasive nature of the testing to arrive at its conclusions, and being consistent with the science of anatomy which has been a part of my life for four decades, makes this the perfect tool for a country like ours to realise noteworthy performances in the sports arena. Having our children SportUnleash tested is of national importance for the development of sports and therefore should be made available to all of our children”</p>

                                <h1>The Game Has Changed</h1>
                                <p>Today’s teenagers live in a fast paced, technologically driven world where everything is accessible at their finger tips. Smartphones, iPads, tablets and Facebook offer a plethora of entertainment making the need to get out and sweat uninviting. Today’s teenagers are more likely to pursue a sport only if they believe they have a good chance of succeeding and making it to their school team.</p>
                                <p>This kind of thinking is reaching epidemic levels whereby teenagers have started to lose out on the benefits sports offer. Many have difficulty working in a group, taking constructive criticism and even handling victory or defeat in their stride. When playing a sport these aspects are carefully nurtured in a controlled environment which helps to build strong character. The physical and mental health benefits lost out are too numerous to count for those children who give up doing a sport early in their school life. This loss tends to also affect their health in the long term as well.</p>
                                <p>It is not just about doing any sport, but choosing the appropriate sport for which each child is gifted with the appropriate physical attributes. New technology today allows us to match a child´s physical attributes with a particular set of sports. This knowledge will automatically help motivate and stimulate passion and commitment within children to continue in a sport throughout their school life and to become the best.</p>

                                <h1>The Prize Money Bigger Than Ever</h1>
                                <p>Over the last decade we have seen an exponential growth in the income generated by sports personalities and sports franchises the world over. As a result of this phenomenon, the desire and the possibility of becoming mega rich sportspeople have begun to drive parents and children alike to dream of such achievements and participate in a sport having such a target in mind; going to great lengths to see this become a reality.</p>
                                <p>However, neither the parents, nor the coaches have a dependable way of predicting the sport a child is best/better suited for. It is a random game of chance where fate is left in the “hands of the gods”. Therefore, the only way forward is for them to then pursue, invest time, energy and commit resources towards such a dream for years, in the blind hope that maybe their child will one day be the next prodigy of the nation or of a wealthy super successful sports franchise.</p>

                                <h1>Emerging/Developing Nations Changing The Game</h1>
                                <p>Sports high performance is the ability for an individual or team to compete in the world arena, and realise noteworthy achievements that are second to none. When such highly motivated and well-trained individuals compete for honours, the margin between victory and defeat is small. Such performances demand precision training and a pioneering spirit that re-invents and challenges the accepted norms for excellence.</p>
                                <p>Sadly however, whenever developing nations such as ours compete against champion teams from the developed world, the margin of defeat is enormous and, after decades of competing, we have become mere spectators at world events. As our economies have become wealthier however, we have invested in acquiring knowledge from coaches in the very countries that create world champions. Unfortunately, our teams’ and sportspeople’s real progress in comparison to the investments made annually is negligible.</p>

                                <h1>Stunted by lack of expertise</h1>
                                <p>Expertise to be able to identify the talent of children at any age level is rare and when this does take place, it is only along the lines of selecting the best talent out of a pool of existing sportsmen in a particular sport or event. If any type of identification of talent is being carried out, it is taking place in a few developed countries behind closed doors and even in such instances by a handful of individuals working on an individual sportsman at a time. No mechanism or expertise is widely available to the public to test the sports talent across schools or a nation within a short period of time, by analysing their physical capabilities and matching them with all the types of sports that exist.</p>
                                <p>This inability to advise, guide and promote the talent of sportsmen at early ages not only stunts our sports development programs, but also hinders our country’s capabilities to uplift its competitiveness in the world arena.</p>
